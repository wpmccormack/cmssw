# ParticleNetAK8-General-V01

This folder contains the ONNX models for the ParticleNet tagger designed for identifying Top/W/Z/H and their decay modes. No mass decorrelation is performed. The model is trained on AK8Puppi jets using `RunIISummer19UL17MiniAOD` and `RunIISummer19UL18MiniAOD` samples with Puppi tune `V14`. 

The output classes of the DNN can be found in the `preprocess.json` file.
