# ParticleNetAK8-General-V00

This folder contains the MXNet models for the ParticleNet tagger designed for identifying Top/W/Z/H and their decay modes. No mass decorrelation is performed. The model is trained on AK8Puppi jets using `RunIIFall17MiniAODv2` samples. 

The output classes of the DNN are:
 - probTbcq
 - probTbqq
 - probTbc
 - probTbq
 - probTbel
 - probTbmu
 - probTbta
 - probWcq
 - probWqq
 - probZbb
 - probZcc
 - probZqq
 - probHbb
 - probHcc
 - probHqqqq
 - probQCDbb
 - probQCDcc
